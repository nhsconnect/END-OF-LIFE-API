## Patient Scenario ##

Consent

On an encounter with a professional, and always on creation of the initial EPaCCS record, the patient will be asked consent to share this data more widely for the purposes of providing them with direct care.

A consent is recorded for a patient based on their meeting with a professional. The Consent FHIR resource has been chosen to represent this consent recording. It can record the status as well as the purpose of the consent, and actors involved (professionals recording this consent status).

Where there is no consent to share on the system, no EOL data will be shared to other consumer systems.
