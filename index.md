# Introduction #

This project specifically supports the development of a digital end of life care interoperability capability, which uses a clinically-assured information standard (SCCI 1580) to support the sharing of end of life care records.  It supports the development and a pilot implementation of the end of life care interoperability API which will allow sharing and updating of a digital end of life care record.  This work is based on a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) aimed at addressing the Urgent and Emergency Care use case.  

The Care Connect RESTful APIs within this site have been developed collaboratively by NHS Digital and the INTEROPen community. These APIs aim to  better support the delivery of care by opening up information and data held across different clinical care settings through the use of nationally defined INTEROPen FHIR® resources.

The INTEROPen vision is to create a library of nationally defined HL7® FHIR® resources and interaction patterns that implementers can adopt to simplify integration and interoperability within UK health and social care.
